# data_pagination_and_filtering
 project 2 FSJS

 Data pagination and filtering application allows user to distribute certain amount of person\student data
 on several pages equally according to total amount (instead of showing all students on one page).

 The search bar at the top allows for student search in accordance with name (first and last),
 while searching pagination is also working depending on the amount of total matches.

 The app is build by using following tools: 'vanilla' Java script(variables, objects, functions, callbacks, loops and conditionals) implied together with the DOM interaction methods (selection, manipulation, traversal and event listening).
